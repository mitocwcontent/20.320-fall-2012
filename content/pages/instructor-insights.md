Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the course _20.320 Analysis of Biomolecular and Cellular Systems_ as it was taught by Professors Forest White and Ernest Fraenkel in Fall 2012.

This course is a required part of the biological engineering undergraduate curriculum. The two central themes of the course are modeling of complex dynamic systems and protein design and engineering.

Course Outcomes
---------------

In _20.320_, students learn how to analyze biological problems mathematically and computationally in order to guide design decisions. The scale of the problems range from proteins, through cellular signaling pathways to whole-body pharmacokinetics.

Student Information
-------------------

![Sixty-one students took this course in Fall 2012.]({{< resource_file 5d3dc2d1-04a2-573d-cd3f-37d2f92736ba >}})

Enrollment has varied from 40 students to 70 students; during the Fall 2012 semester, 61 students enrolled in this course. Typically, most students taking this course are third-year undergraduates majoring in biological engineering.

The Classroom
-------------

*   ![A large classroom with tiered seating and several chalkboards.]({{< resource_file 87ccd1c9-c71d-1f9f-be0a-126ce8eaaea9 >}})

    ### Lecture
    
    A large auditorium-style classroom was used for lectures. The professors used both the chalkboards and the projector.
    
*   ![A medium-sized classroom with student desks and several chalkboards.]({{< resource_file 784d7817-4ec4-3ba8-61ab-2850b8524213 >}})

How Student Time Was Spent
--------------------------

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

Lecture
-------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1.5 hours per session; 24 sessions total.

Recitation
----------

*   Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 24 sessions total.
*   Two sessions were created to accommodate the students’ schedules; both sessions covered the same material.
*   Recitations were optional.

Out of Class
------------

*   Read the optional [reading assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/modeling-of-cellular-systems#Reading_Material)
*   Work on the [design projects]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/modeling-of-cellular-systems/protein-networks-project)
*   Complete the optional [study problems]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/study-materials)
*   Study for [exams]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/exams)
